*HR distance* is a metric used to evaluate the performance of VQE that only requires a polynomial number of measurements with respect to the number of operators. HR distance was introduced in (arxiv link)

In this repository, we provide two examples of using HR distance as a metric in VQE for two different systems: the 1D Transverse Field Ising model (1D TFIM) and the J1-J2 model.
